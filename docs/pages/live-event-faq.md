## General Questions

---

#### Is there a Rookie division or Veteran division?
Teams can enter three different brackets at the tournament depending on experience and length of time they have been working on their snake. Whether you are a first time programmer who has never entered a Battlesnake tournament or a senior developer with multiple tournaments under your belt, there is a place for you to compete.

---

#### Is there a maximum team size?
No, but we find teams of 2-4 tend to have the most success.

---

#### When do I register my team?
At the Live event, on March 15 at the Conference Centre. There will be a Team Registration Table beside the check-in table.

---

#### I don’t have a team, can I still compete?
Yes, you can compete as a team of one or join a team the day of.

---

#### Who is the event for?
Everyone is welcome, either as a competitor or a spectator.

#### What is a Bounty Snake?
Bounty Snakes are snakes created by our sponsors with prizes and swag attached to different types of win parameters. Throughout the day, you can challenge a Bounty Snake to try and win the Bounty attached to it.

---

#### Will there be food?
Yes! Lunch, coffee, tea and snacks will be provided throughout the day.

---

#### Do I need to know how to program?
