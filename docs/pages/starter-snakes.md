## Contributing Your Own Starter Snake

**Want to submit your Starter Snake Project?** Wonderful! You can [submit a pull request or create an issue](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/docs) and we'll take a look. Community created Starter Snakes must contain the following before being listed:

* Contain just enough code to run a basic snake server and nothing more.
* Return hardcoded responses back to the game engine.
* Be well documented for developers wanting to use it.
* Provide simple, extensible unit tests.
* Ideally involve a single file of source code.
