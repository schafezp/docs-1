            <h2>What is Battlesnake?</h2>
            <p>
              A Battlesnake is a programmed web server that implements the <a href="/snake-api"
                target="_blank">Battlesnake API</a> to play the game snake against other Battlesnakes. When a game
              is running, the Battlesnake Game Engine will make HTTP requests to your server, sending you game
              information and asking for your next move.
            </p>

            <h2>Step 1: Build Your Snake</h2>
            <p>
              Select a technology you want to use to program your snake. Anything that can process a web request and be
              deployed to the internet will work.
              There are several <a href="/starter-snakes">Starter Snakes</a> that can be used as a base if you
              don't want to start from scratch. Each is built with a popular programming language and web application
              framework.

              <p>
                Your Battlesnake must support 4 endpoints that will be called by the Game Engine:

                <strong>/start</strong>, <strong>/move</strong> and <strong>/end</strong> requests will all
                contain
                a Game ID that uniquely identifies which game the request is for. You should develop your snake to
                handle requests from different games at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Step 2 - Deploy Your Snake</h2>
            <p>
              Before your snake can do battle, it must be deployed to a publicly accessible server. This can be done
              using
              a
              cloud hosting provider such as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a> or <a
                href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>. Many of these services provide a
              free tier
              for
              deploying web servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many of the <a href="/starter-snakes">Starter Snakes</a> have instructions on how to deploy the snakes to
              a public Heroku instance so you can get started quickly.

                are boring and fail to tell people about the character of your snake. That said, creativity has limits
                and make sure not to violate the Battlesnake <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/about/conduct/">Code
