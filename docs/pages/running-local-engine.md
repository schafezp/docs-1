# The Battlesnake Engine

The engine is what runs Battlesnake games and makes the requests to your snake server. Any time you use the [Create Game](https://play.battlesnake.com/account/games/create/) form on [play.battlesnake.com](play.battlesnake.com), you are communicating with the Battlesnake engine. We encourage everyone to use this publicly available engine for Battlesnake testing and debugging as it will always run the latest version of the code and will contain the rule sets used in public events and tournaments.

# Running a Local Engine

Some users prefer to run a local version of the engine server to assist with debugging and development iteration. For this purpose we have provided some binary releases of the engine server that users can setup. These binaries are from a older version of the engine, that provides the basic functionality for testing core snake behavior.

## Step 1:  the Binary Release

Download the [latest engine release](https://github.com/battlesnakeio/engine/releases/tag/0.2.25) for your architecture to a folder somewhere on your machine

Unpack/unzip the downloaded release. You should have an engine binary, the LICENSE, and the README available in the unpackaged folder


## Step 2: Start the Engine

Open a terminal window and run the engine binary with `./engine dev` (on MacOS & Linux) or `engine dev` (on Windows)

When the engine launches it should show output the following:

```
$ ./engine dev
INFO[0000] dev form available at http://localhost:3010/
INFO[0000] Battlesnake controller serving                listen=":3004"

INFO[0000] Battlesnake worker starting                   worker=8
INFO[0000] controller rpc                                duration="23.55Âµs" method=/pb.Controller/Ping
INFO[0000] connection to controller healthy              version=unreleased
```

## Step 3: Create a Game

Running the engine in dev mode will launch a web server with a simple form for creating games. In a browser, go to (http://localhost:3010/). You should see a page that looks the image below. The left side of the page is the form for creating a game. The right side of the page is the Battlenake board, which will render once a game is started.

To start a game, just provide a *name* and *URL* for your snake, then click on the **Start Game** button.

The game will be created on local engine server and start running. You should see traffic hit your snake server and within a few seconds the game will be rendered on the board. Click on the Play link at the bottom of the board to watch the game. In addition, use the **Add Snake** button to define up to 8 snakes for a game.
